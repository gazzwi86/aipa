# Web Research Skill

Gather and synthesize information from the web.

## When to Activate

- "Research..."
- "Find out about..."
- "What is...?"
- "How does X work?"
- "Look up..."

## Research Process

1. **Understand the question** - What exactly is needed?
2. **Search strategically** - Use specific terms
3. **Evaluate sources** - Prioritize authoritative sources
4. **Synthesize** - Combine findings
5. **Present** - Format appropriately for voice/text

## Source Priority

1. Official documentation
2. Authoritative sources (gov, edu, established orgs)
3. Expert content (recognized experts)
4. Quality articles (reputable publications)
5. Community sources (verify carefully)

## Voice Response Format

Brief, answer-first:
> "The answer is X. This is because Y. Want more detail?"

## Text Response Format

```markdown
## Summary
Direct answer to the question.

## Key Points
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

## Sources
- [Source 1](url)
- [Source 2](url)
```

## MCP Servers

- `playwright` - Web browsing for research
- `notion` - Save findings to Notes

## Save to Notion

When research is substantial:
1. Ask: "Should I save this to your Notes?"
2. If yes, create Note with category "Research"
3. Include sources and date

## Limitations

- Can't access paywalled content
- Real-time data may be delayed
- Always cite sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty
