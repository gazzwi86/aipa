- **Competitive Rivalry**: Number of competitors, market growth rate

### 2. Strategic Group Mapping
Clusters competitors by key dimensions:
- For **consulting firms**: Service breadth vs. specialization, Price point vs. value positioning
- For **tech companies**: Feature completeness vs. simplicity, Enterprise vs. SMB focus
- For **SaaS**: Vertical specialization vs. horizontal platform

### 3. SWOT Analysis (Per Competitor)
- **Strengths**: Internal capabilities, competitive advantages
- **Weaknesses**: Gaps, vulnerabilities
- **Opportunities**: Market trends they can exploit

## Response Format

### Voice (Brief)
> "I've completed the competitive analysis for Versent. They're positioned mid-market in the AWS consulting space, competing mainly with Servian, AC3, and Telstra Purple. Their main advantage is the Infosys partnership giving them global reach, but they're vulnerable to larger integrators like Accenture moving downmarket. Full report is saved to your Notes. Want me to highlight any specific competitor?"
